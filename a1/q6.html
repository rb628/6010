<b>a. Explain how online education can be a disruptive technology in education industry. <br />What are the advantages of online education? <br />
   What are the disadvantages? </b><br/>

Online education replaces live lectures and are asynchronous in nature.They can be accessible from anywhere,anytime at low cost.
This enables students from around the world to take part without paying tuition,collecting a college degree and saving upon living cost. 
They could be a threat to traditional institutions. The main disadvantage is they are less social,face to face interactions with fellow students 
and professors is limited to none.
Virtual office hours and online discussion forums form the medium of communication for students to ask and answer questions. 
As the lectures could be recorded once and played n number of times, with technological advancements(highly automated, with computer-graded assignment  
and exams) it might pose a big threat to community colleges and universities.<br /><br />

<b>b. Explain why disruptive technologies are often low quality initially. Why is low quality an advantage? How do they overcome the quality issue? </b> <br />

Disruptive technologies are the ones that are new to the market at really low price, with decent performance targetted to satisfy customers needs  
when compared to its established competitors. For example, chrome book, a cheaper inferior product released a while ago in the market. 
These technologies are often low quality initially to serve an unprofitable market niche, avoid competitive reaction and to expand market penetration slowly. They aim at providing less-than-desired performance to make it even better from a user experience standpoint. As technology improves,  <br />
the low quality technologies upgrade to mainstream thereby overcoming their quality issue.The high end competitors lack simplicity. They try to add  
additional performance and features there by making the system more complex and expensive to the end user. <br /><br />
        
<b>c. Do you anticipate any disruptive technologies in your business? If yes, how do you expect to counter the threat; if no, why not?</b> <br />

We are looking at free ebooks, electronic books(ie.,non paper market(kindle))as our threat. But we bank on the customers who solidly read paper books for our business to thrive.
