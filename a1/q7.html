<b>7a. What are (positive) Network Effects? Give an example of a product with network effects, and explain.</b><br />

Network effects is typical of networking and communication technologies where the value of a product to a user increases with the total number of users.
Total value of the technology is a quadratic function of the number of users. More the users, better the experience and value to the user.
For example, in the android and IOS mobile markets, applications like watsapp and viber.They are used to communicate/message/call, the more friends on them 
the better to connect, share and communicate.<br /><br />

<b>b. Are there network effects in any product in your business? If yes, explain why and what your strategy is to use those network effects to your advantage. <br />
If not, explain if fashion and reputation can lead to network effects in your products. </b> <br />
We provide a platform for our customers to exchange their books directly.Yes there are network effects in that case. 
The more people use our online library, the more options for exchange.  
Our strategy is discount/free initial trial to chime in many people to contribute and benefit from the service.
We plan to introduce cut/flat rates to employees of organisations with whom we have a contract and introduce a scheme where the customer can borrow 2 books 
while lending one of their own.<br /><br />

<b>c. Read the article on Network Effects on the Web, and explain the economic problems caused by Network effects. Give an example from the article.</b> <br />
Networks have a natural tendency to grow, and that growth leads to dominance. Every time the leader is followed for ostensibly good reasons, 
the consequence is a narrowing of our choices. For example,AT&T was the successor of Western Union's telegraph, reached more people than anyone else's, 
so ever more customers came to depend on them in a feedback loop of expanding market share. 
AT&T's near-absolute dominion over the telephone lasted from about 1914 until the 1984 breakup, all the while delaying the advent of lower prices 
and innovative technologies that new entrants would eventually bring. Today, Verizon and AT&T's dominance of wireless phone service can be credited 
in part to de facto assistance from the U.S., and consequently their niche is probably the safest in the entire industry. <br /><br />
