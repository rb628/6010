     <b> Our Competitors</b><br />
    <p> * <b>Tompkins County Public Library</b><br /> Though users can search for titles online, they have to visit the library to borrow a book.<br /> We provide doorstep delivery and pick up of books. <br />
* <b>Cornell Library and Ithaca College Library</b><br /> They are dedicated only for the students. We offer library services for everyone.<br />

<br /><b>What sets us apart?</b><br /><br />
* Our doorstep delivery and pick up service is the best competitive edge over our competitors in Ithaca. People do not have to go to the library to pick up their favourite book. We provide a library at their doorstep!<br />
* We also have tie ups with authors. We arrange online chat sessions with authors that help readers connect with their favourite authors and vice versa<br />
* We provide book review services which is of advantage to us in two ways. We increase our book collection and we provide book reviews for readers. <br />
* We also provide a platform for our readers to exchange books at very nominal prices. We do the pick up and delivery of books.</p><br />
